AI Delivery Assets

Visuals and frameworks used to guide predictive machine learning (ML) program delivery, experimentation, and production readiness across enterprise environments.

Overview

This repository contains diagrams illustrating the end-to-end delivery lifecycle for supervised machine learning and predictive analytics initiatives. These visuals reflect delivery frameworks I have used across enterprise AI/ML programs — including recommendation engines, risk prediction models, and forecasting solutions.

The frameworks represent my approach as a Senior Program Manager to align Engineering, Product, Data Science, Compliance, and UI teams around predictable, outcome-driven AI delivery.

Featured Framework: Predictive ML Thin-Slice Delivery Model

The main diagram represents a structured delivery approach designed to accelerate ML execution and reduce risk. It includes three major phases that loop iteratively:

1. Project Initiation

Define business goals and success metrics

Establish architecture and technical approach

Build epics, roadmap, and initial backlog

Confirm data access, pipelines, and environments

Identify compliance requirements and risks

Enable cross-functional access (engineering, data science, UI/UX)

This creates a unified foundation for experimentation.

2. ML Experimental Sprints (with Early App Integration)

Each ML sprint includes both model experimentation and application-layer integration to support fast learning cycles:

Model Work:

Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering

Train/evaluate multiple model candidates

Conduct A/B or side-by-side comparisons

Rapid thin-slice iterations to identify top performers

Application / Product Work:

Build early UI/API endpoints for model output

Integrate prediction scores into dashboards, alerts, or workflows

Conduct early user testing or internal demos

Validate usability, risk indicators, and business logic

Support A/B testing at the product interface level

This combined ML + UI approach ensures the actual product experience evolves alongside the model, enabling early feedback from users, stakeholders, or compliance reviewers.

3. Productionization & Governance

Finalize model selection based on A/B results

Harden APIs and integrate into the application

Establish automated monitoring, drift detection, and alerting

Connect to CI/CD pipelines

Document model behavior, governance rules, and user guidance

Prepare for deployment reviews (security, compliance, privacy)

This ensures AI solutions move into production safely, predictably, and with long-term maintainability.

Applicability:

While this diagram is based on predictive ML programs, the same delivery principles — iterative experimentation, UI/API integration, structured evaluation, and governance — also apply to:

AI compliance workflows

content analysis and classification systems

supervised learning for communication monitoring

risk scoring and regulatory automation
